This repository contains scripts for managing multiple outstanding patches to
TripleO (or other gerrit based projects).

 - tooling to combine arbitrary unmerged gerrit patches (prep_source_repos)
   which will also export an rc file with git refs based on the combined
   branches
 - a sample config file that we're using (repo_refs.yaml)

To use:

* create a repo_refs.yaml in your TRIPLEO_ROOT (see the one in the root of this
  repository for inspiration).

* add the tripleo-end-to-end bin directory to your path (or symlink the
  specific scripts into place, or $up to you).

* run prep_source_repos $YOUR\_REFS\_FILE $TRIPLEO\_ROOT to checkout and update
  the repositories specified by the refs file

* source YOUR_REFS_FILE.variables to configure TripleO scripts to use your
  freshly integrated branches

* proceed with any tripleo activies you might have (building images, deploying,
  etc etc).
