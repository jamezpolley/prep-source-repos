This repository is a place for testers of full rack end-to-end TripleO
runs to coordinate around reproducible deployments.

repo_refs.yaml contains the various repos TripleO will clone and allows
you to track in-flight Gerrit reviews that need to be pulled down as
part of the deployment.

To use:

Ideally, maintain a local rc file with environment variables specific
to your environment.  To view which you should be setting, see top of
devtestrc.

You'll also want to maintain a nodes.json and bm-network.json specific
to your node inventory and seed/undercloud network topology. See examples.

With your local overrides and nodes.json and bm-network.json in place, simply
source devtestrc.  This will clone all required repos and patches every time
its sourced.  To skip this part, set NO_SOURCE_PREP=1.  Note without this set,
you'll likely lose local changes to the repos upon resourcing.

Then you may simply run:

devtest.sh  --trash-my-machine --nodes $PATH_TO/nodes.json --bm-networks $PATH_TO/bm-network.json
